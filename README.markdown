Nikemove is a web app designed to assist users in achieving their exercise goals by synchronizing with their movement rhythm by using Face Detection and Speech Recognition. This innovative robot acts as a virtual exercise guide, walking users through each step of their workout routine and adapting to their exercise pace.

When the user initiates the app by clicking the start button, Nikemove utilizes detection technology to determine the user's presence. Once the user is detected, the robot employs speech recognition capabilities to understand the user's commands and respond accordingly. Nikemove proceeds to provide instructions for the next exercise action, delivering both verbal explanations and visual demonstration images. It prompts the user for confirmation by requesting them to say "next move".

Furthermore, Nikemove intelligently handles situations when the user is temporarily absent, pausing speech recognition until the user returns. This feature ensures seamless interaction and prevents interruptions during exercise sessions. Overall, Nikemove combines charm and intelligence, making it an exciting tool to enhance workout experiences.

In summary, Nikemove offers a user-friendly and interactive platform for exercising, catering to individual exercise rhythms and providing real-time guidance. Its ability to adapt to the user's pace and respond to commands makes it a valuable companion for achieving fitness goals.
